The key analysis issues for each step that are listed below the lines are discussed in the text. a Preprocessing includes experimental design, sequencing design, and quality control steps. b Core analyses include transcriptome profiling, differential gene expression, and functional profiling. c Advanced analysis includes visualization, other RNA-seq technologies, and data integration. Abbreviations: ChIP-seq Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing, eQTL Expression quantitative loci, FPKM Fragments per kilobase of exon model per million mapped reads, GSEA Gene set enrichment analysis, PCA Principal component analysis, RPKM Reads per kilobase of exon model per million reads, sQTL Splicing quantitative trait loci, TF Transcription factor, TPM Transcripts per million.\n\n\n\nRead mapping and transcript identification strategies.\n\n\nThree basic strategies for regular RNA-seq analysis. a An annotated genome is available and reads are mapped to the genome with a gapped mapper. Next (novel) transcript discovery and quantification can proceed with or without an annotation file. Novel transcripts are then functionally annotated. b If no novel transcript discovery is needed, reads can be mapped to the reference transcriptome using an ungapped aligner. Transcript identification and quantification can occur simultaneously. c When no genome is available, reads need to be assembled first into contigs or transcripts. For quantification, reads are mapped back to the novel reference transcriptome and further analysis proceeds as in (b) followed by the functional annotation of the novel transcripts as in (a). Representative software that can be used at each analysis step are indicated in bold text.

    "text": "2.2 Experimental design\nAre technical replicates needed for RNA-Seq analyses?\n\nWe find that the Illumina sequencing data are highly replicable, with relatively little technical variation, and thus, for many purposes, it may suffice to sequence each mRNA sample only once.\n\nMarioni et al. (2008)\nHow many biological replicates are needed in an RNA-seq experiment?\n\n\n\n\n\nSchurch et al. (2016)\nNumber of replicates can be calculated more precisely using power analysis.

(2013)\nMore sequencing depth or more biological replicates?\n\n\n\n(a) Increase in biological replication significantly increases the number of DE genes identified. Numbers of sequencing reads have a diminishing return after 10 M reads. Line thickness indicates depth of replication, with 2 replicates the darkest and 7 replicates the lightest. The lines are smoothed averages for each replication level, with the shaded regions corresponding to the 95% confidence intervals. (b) Power of detecting DE genes increases with both sequencing depth and biological replication. Similar to the trends in (a), increases in the power showed diminishing returns after 10 M reads. (c) ROC curves for three biological replicates. Sequencing deeper than 10 M reads did not significantly improve statistical power and precision for detecting DE genes. (d) The CV of logFC for the top 100 DE genes. The CV of the logFC estimates decreased significantly as we added more biological replicates, whereas adding sequencing depth after 10 M reads had much less effect.\n\n\n\n\n\n(a–c) The CV of logCPM for high expression level genes (a), medium expression level genes (b) and low expression level genes (c) (see Section 2 for definition). High/medium expression level genes have low CV for expression level estimates. Adding sequencing depth did not have significant effect on accuracy of estimation, whereas adding biological replicates improved accuracy significantly. For low expression level genes, both adding sequencing depth and adding biological replication level improved expression level estimation accuracy. (d) Number of DE genes plotted against the total estimated sequencing cost. If higher numbers of DE genes are needed, increased biological replication should be used.\n\n\nY. Liu et al. (2014)"

    "text": "2.3 RNA extraction\nImpact of RNA degradation on transcript quantification\n\nWe observed widespread effects of RNA quality on measurements of gene expression levels, as well as a slight but significant loss of library complexity in more degraded samples.\nWhile standard normalizations failed to account for the effects of degradation, we found that by explicitly controlling for the effects of RIN using a linear model framework we can correct for the majority of these effects. We conclude that in instances in which RIN and the effect of interest are not associated, this approach can help recover biologically meaningful signals in data from degraded RNA samples.\n\n\n\n\nA) PCA plot of the 15 samples included in the study based on data from 29,156 genes with at least one mapped read in a single individual.

We further find that, in addition to miRNAs, some pre-miRNAs, small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes, and transfer RNAs (tRNAs) are also extracted inefficiently under these conditions, reducing their representation in the pool of recovered RNAs.\n\nKim et al.

(A) Boxplots of log2(counts + 1) for all conditions and replicates in the M. musculus data, by normalization method. (B) Boxplots of intra-group variance for one of the conditions (labeled ‘B’ in the corresponding data found in Supplementary Data) in the M. musculus data, by normalization method. (C) Analysis of housekeeping genes for the H. sapiens data. (D) Consensus dendrogram of differential analysis results, using the DESeq Bioconductor package, for all normalization methods across the four datasets under consideration.\n\n\nDillies et al. (2013)\n\n\n\nOne highly expressed gene. An experiment is performed with conditions A and B to compare expression for the three genes (1, 2 and 3). (A) Gene 3 is 2-fold up-regulated under condition B, while the other genes are not DE; the quantity of mRNA/cell (in bp) is the same for genes 1 and 2, but is twice as high for gene 3 under condition B. (B) Because of the change in expression of gene 3, the shares of mRNA in the cell are different between conditions. Under condition A, each gene gets one-third, whereas under condition B, gene 3 gets half while the other two get one-fourth. (C) Differences in shares of mRNA are reflected in the shares of reads. Each sample has the same total number of reads, but the distribution is different between the conditions, matching the distribution of mRNA in (B). (D) When no normalization is performed, there are apparent differences in read counts for all three genes. Total count normalization produces the exact same result as no normalization at all, as the total read count for each sample is the same. In truth, there is no difference in expression for genes 1 and 2, and the relative count for gene 3 should be higher than found by no normalization or total count normalization. Correct normalization, therefore, makes the read counts of the non-DE genes equivalent, which also makes the relative expression of gene 3 correct. (E) No normalization and total count normalization fail to equilibrate the read counts of the non-DE genes, resulting in each gene appearing DE, and the truly DE gene (gene 3) having the wrong fold change. Correct normalization reveals no difference in expression for the non-DE genes and the correct fold change for gene 3.\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobal shift in expression. There are two genes, and an experiment is performed to compare expression between condition A and condition B. (A) There is global up-regulation under condition B versus condition A, with both genes having twice the expression under condition B. Within each condition, the two genes produce the same amount of mRNA/cell (measured in bp). (B) In the RNA-Seq experiment, the same number of molecules are sequenced from each of the two samples. Proportionally, the mRNA composition is the same under each condition, and so the composition of molecules sequenced is also the same. Within each condition, the two genes produce the same amount of mRNA (in bp) but gene 2 is four-fifth the length of gene 1, so must produce five-fourth the number of molecules that gene 1 does. (C) Sequenced reads are aligned to the reference genome and mapped to each gene. The distribution of reads is the same in each sample, but by chance the sample for condition A happens to have more reads in total. (D) Normalization is performed, which removes the differences in read count from technical variability, so the read count for each gene is the same across conditions. (E) Because the normalized read counts are the same, the observed fold change for each gene is 1, indicating no differential expression. However, genes are really twice as expressed under condition B and so in truth we should see half the expression when comparing A with B.\n\n\nEvans et al. (2018)\n\n2.9.1 Use of RPKM & TPM\nIssues with RPKM and suggestion for use of TPM.\nWagner et al. (2012)\n\nBelow is a suggested workflow to follow in order to compare RPKM or TPM values across samples. 1. Make sure both samples are sequenced using the same protocol in terms of strandedness. If not, samples cannot be compared. 2. Make sure both samples use the same RNA isolation approach (polyA+ selection vs ribosomal RNA depletion). If not, they should not be compared. 3. Check the fraction of the ribosomal, mitochondrial and globin RNAs, and the top highly expressed transcripts and see whether such RNAs constitute a very large part of the sequenced reads in a sample, and thus decrease the sequencing ‘real estate’ available for the remaining genes in that sample. If the calculated fractions in two samples differ significantly, do not compare RPKM or TPM values directly. TPM should never be used for quantitative comparisons across samples when the total RNA contents and its distributions are very different. However, under appropriate circumstances, TPM can be still useful for qualitative comparison such as PCA and clustering analysis.\n\nZhao et al. (2020)"

They all also perform better when the sparsity (zero counts) is less. For data with a high level of multimodality, methods that consider the behavior of each individual gene, such as DESeq2, EMDomics, Monocle2, DEsingle, and SigEMD, show better TPRs. If the level of multimodality is low, however, SCDE, MAST, and edgeR can provide higher precision.\n\n\nIn general, the methods that can capture multimodality (non-parametric methods), perform better than do the model-based methods designed for handling zero counts. However, a model-based method that can model the drop-out events well, can perform better in terms of true positive and false positive. We observed that methods developed specifically for scRNAseq data do not show significantly better performance compared to the methods designed for bulk RNAseq data; and methods that consider behavior of each individual gene (not all genes) in calling DE genes outperform the other tools.\n\n\n\n\nEffect of sample size (number of cells) on detecting DE genes.

    "text": "3.8 VDJ\n\n3.8.1 TCR review\n\nHuman T cells develop in the thymus and they acquire the ability to recognize foreign antigens and provide protection against many different pathogens.\nThis functional flexibility is guaranteed by the expression of highly polymorphic surface receptors called T cell receptors (TCRs).\nTCR is composed of two different protein chains. The vast majority of human T cells express TCRs composed of α (alpha) and β (beta) chains.\nThe genes encoding alpha (TCRA) and beta (TCRAB) chains are composed of multiple non-contiguous gene segments which include variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) segments for TCRB gene and variable (V) and joining (J) for TCRA gene.\nThe enormous diversity of T cell repertoires is generated by random combinations of germ line gene segments (combinatorial diversity) and by random addition or deletion at the junction site of the segments that have been joined (junctional diversity).\nThe sequence encoded by the V(D)J junction is called complementarity determining region 3 or CDR3. This sequence has the highest variability in both alpha and beta chains and determines the ability of a T cell to recognize an antigen.\nThe total number of possible combination is estimated to exceed 10e18.\nThe diversity of naïve T cells is the T cell repertoire\nExposure to an antigen drives a rapid clonal expansion of cells carrying identical TCRs to generate a population of “effector cells.”\nAfter antigen clearance, a reduced number of these cells remain in the blood as “memory cells.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDe Simone et al.
