## Overview

There are three major resolution scales in ST data:

- multi-cell
- single-cell
- sub-cellular

## Techniques
### [10X Visium](https://www.10xgenomics.com/platforms/visium)

As of May 2024, there are three assays: Spatial GEX, Spatial GEX + Protein and Spatial GEX HD.

|Assay|Spatial GEX|Spatial GEX+Protein|Spatial GEX HD|
|---|---|---|---|
|Scope|Whole transcriptome|Whole transcriptome+31 Proteins|Whole transcriptome|
|Spatial resolution|multi-cell|multi-cell|single-cell|
|Tissue|FFPE,Fresh frozen,Fixed frozen|FFPE|FFPE|
|Species|Various|Human,Mouse|Human,Mouse|
|Capture area|6.5x6.5mm|6.5x6.5mm|6.5x6.5mm|
|Total spots|~5K/~14K|~5K/~14K|~11.2M|
|Spot size|55um circle|55um circle|2um square|

In addition, the Visium slides come in different types depending on the assay and version.

### Cell interaction

Given the relative stability of cellular locations, spatial transcriptomics allows us to reveal cellâ€“cell interactions (CCI),
also referred to as cell-cell communications (CCC), with fewer false positives than similar analysis with scRNA-seq data.
