RNA-Seq experiment where the source material is usually from tissue.

## [Single-Cell RNA-Seq](./documentation/scrnaseq.html)  
RNA-Seq experiment where the source material is single cells. Methods such as 10X chromium, Smart-Seq etc.

## [Spatial RNA-Seq](./documentation/spatial.html)
RNA-Seq data with spatial information. 10X Visium etc.

## [Meta transcriptomics](./documentation/meta-rnaseq.html)
